    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "I normalize each numerical feature. I use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 1:  Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Real-world application:\n",
    "Decision trees are a powerful prediction method and extremely popular. One such real world implementation is use decision trees to predict whether a loan application is a good one or bad one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Strengths of the model:\n",
    " Able to handle categorical and numerical data.\n",
    " Doesn't require much data pre-processing.\n",
    " Can handle data which hasn't been normalized, or encoded for Machine Learning Suitability. \n",
    " Simple to understand and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "Complex Decision Trees do not generalize well to the data and can result in overfitting. Unstable, as small variations in the data can result in a different decision tree. Hence they are usually used in an ensemble (like Random Forests) to build robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem?:\n",
    "Since a decision tree can handle both numerical and categorical data, it's a good candidate for our case (although, the pre-processing steps might already mitigate whatever advantage we would have had). It's also easy to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 2:  Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Real-world application:\n",
    "Support Vector Machine are used to recognize handwritten characters used for data entry and to validate document signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Strengths of the model:\n",
    "Effective in high dimensional spaces, or when there are a lot of features. Kernel functions can be used to adapt to different cases, and can be completely customized if needed. Thus SVMs are versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    " Doesn't perform well with large datasets. Doesn't directly provide probability estimates.\n",
    " \n",
    "* ##### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem?:\n",
    "SVMs were chosen for their effectiveness due to their high dimensions. After incorporating dummy variables, we have over 100 features in our dataset, so SVMs should be a classifier that works regardless. Also, our dataset is not so large as to be a deterrent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 3: Adaboost\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Real-world application:\n",
    "This model can be applied to most real-world classification problems. This approach may be appropriate when we have a lot of data and do not have a good idea of the features that might contribute to the results we are interested in explaining. For example, if we are a new employee of Netflix and want to create a model that predicts the types \n",
    "of shows, a user would like to participate in based on features like age, gender, previous shows watched, and other features that might be new to us, this approach would work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Strengths of the model:\n",
    "A strength of this model is its performance. It performs well for most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "Since ensemble methods use a number of different models, they are not as interpretable as other models with coefficients (such as logistic regression). Processing time is also longer for adaboost models than other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem?:\n",
    "This model is a good candidate for a problem since it generally has strong performance with datasets with many features (our dataset contains 103, which is a large number), accepts categorical and numeric variables as inputs (our dataset contains both), and deals with Datasets well with unbalanced target groups (our dataset has a positive category prevalence of 24.78%, which is unbalanced). This form gives more importance to related features.\n",

    "The AdaBoost Classifier is a boosting ensemble method of decision trees. In an ensemble method, a group of weak learners (in our case, decision trees) learn from the data and make predictions of the target variable. The prediction of each weak learner is taken into account and combined (as a count or “vote” with categorical targets, and an average for numeric ones) to produce a result more accurate than otherwise produced by an individual learner. In a boosting method, the performance of each week learner is evaluated, and better performing learners are given a higher weight or larger “vote” when their outputs are combined to decide the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our cases, the weak learners are decision trees. A decision tree algorithm separates, multiple times over several iterations, the data based on feature values. During model training, these data splits are chosen based on how well the target variable labels are classified. For instance, if we are classifying labels A and B, we want as many A variables to go to one branch as possible, and as many B ones to the other. How efficient this target class separation is done is measured by a loss function, such as gini index or entropy. The decision tree tries all possible splits and selects the one with the optimal loss function. The algorithm then goes to the next depth level and finds the next best split, repeating this process for each node until the tree reaches its maximum depth. When making predictions, data goes through each split, being separated by the threshold determined during training, to finally reach a leaf with a target class prediction.\n",
    "The number of questions (or splits) on the data is called the tree depth, the separated subsets of data are called branches, and the final predictions are called leaves. As mentioned earlier, in our AdaBoost classifier, we have multiple decision trees as weak learners, each with a different performance and weight, which outputs we combine the obtain our final prediction."

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
