    "In this project, I employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 1:  Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Real-world application:\n",
    "Support Vector Machine correctly classifies invisible data. Such as determining the classification of genes and patients on the basis of genes and other biological problems\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Strengths of the model:\n",
    "Support Vector Machineis more effective in high dimensional spaces, is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "SVM is relatively memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "Support Vector Machine algorithm is not suitable for large data sets, does not perform very well when the data set has more noise .\n",
    "Doesn't directly provide probability estimates.\n",
    " \n",
    "* ##### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem?:\n",
    "\n",
    "were chosen for their effectiveness due to their high dimensions. After incorporating dummy variables, we have 103 features in our dataset, so SVMs should be a classifier that works regardless. Also, our dataset is not so large as to be a deterrent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 2: Adaboost\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Real-world application:\n",
    "This model can be applied to most real-world classification problems. This approach may be appropriate when we have a lot of data and do not have a good idea of the features that might contribute to the results we are interested in explaining.such as predicting customer churn and classifying the types of topics customers are talking/calling about.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Strengths of the model:\n",
    "A strength of this model is its performance. It performs well for most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "Boosting technique learns progressively, it is important to make sure you have good data. AdaBoost is also very sensitive to loud data and outliers, so if you are planning to use AdaBoost, it is highly recommended to get rid of it.\n",
    "also, Since ensemble methods use a number of different models, they are not as interpretable as other models with coefficients (such as logistic regression). \n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem?:\n",
    "This Adaboost is a good candidate for our problem because it has strong performance with datasets that contain many features, our dataset contains 103, and it also accepts categorical and numeric variables as inputs and dataset contains both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 3: Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Real-world application:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest algorithm used in a variety of applications such as the stock market, the random forest algorithm is used to determine the behavior of stock as well as the expected loss or profit through the purchase of a particular stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Strengths of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest can be used to solve both classification as well as regression problems and works well with both categorical and continuous variables.\n",
    "also, a Random Forest can automatically handle missing values and is comparatively less impacted by noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest is complex and requires more time to train compared to decision trees because it generates a lot of trees (instead of one tree in the case of a decision tree) and decides on the majority of votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### What makes this model a good candidate for the problem?:\n",
    "\n",

    "AdaBoost is the first realization of boosting algorithms in 1996 by Freund & Schapire.\n",
    "The underlying classifier in a boosting algorithm is called 'base classifier'. This underlying base classifier for AdaBoost is a decision stamp which is a decision tree with one level. A major goal of the AdaBoost algorithm is to combine these really weak one-level decision stamp classifiers and generate a strong classifier at the end.\n",
    "In other word , we apply base learning (ML) algorithms with a different distribution To find weak rule,. Each time base learning algorithm is applied, it generates a new weak prediction rule. This is an iterative process. After many iterations, the boosting algorithm combines these weak rules into a single strong prediction rule and  which eventually improves the prediction power of the model. Boosting pays higher focus on examples which are mis-classiﬁed or have higher errors by preceding weak rules and in our case, the weak learners are the decision trees. The decision tree algorithm separates multiple times over several iterations until the tree reaches its maximum depth. When making predictions, the data passes through each division, and is separated by the threshold set during training,to finally reach a leaf with a target class prediction."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
