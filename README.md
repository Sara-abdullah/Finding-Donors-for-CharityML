# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
# Project Motivation
This project is part of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree projects.
# Project Overview
In this project, I apply supervised learning techniques and analytical methods to data collected for the US Census to help CharityML (a fictitious charitable organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. Explore the data to find out how the census data is recorded. Next, I apply a series of transformations and pre-processing techniques to process the data in a practical format. Then I evaluate multiple supervised learners of the data, and consider what works best for the solution. After that, I refine the model I chose and present it as the solution for CharityML. Finally, I explore the chosen model and its prospects under the hood, to see how well it performed when looking at the data presented.
# data
The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid", by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
